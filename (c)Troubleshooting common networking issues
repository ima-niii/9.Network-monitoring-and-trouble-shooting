2.Troubleshooting Common Networking Issues
Step 1: Check Network Status
nmcli
# or
ip a

Step 2: Test Network Connectivity
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8

Step 3: Check DNS Configuration
Verify /etc/resolv.conf points to a working DNS server.
Check /etc/nsswitch.conf for correct DNS resolution.

Step 4: Check Firewall Rules
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Step 5: Check for IP Conflicts
Ensure every device has a unique IP.

Step 6: Check Physical/Virtual Connections
Physical server: verify cables, switch ports, NIC status.

Virtual server: verify VM host networking.

Step 7: Restart Network Services
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
 Or, if NetworkManager is not used:
sudo systemctl restart network

Step 8: Troubleshoot Network Hardware
Check NICs, switches, or routers.

*Test on a different network connection if needed.

Step 9: Check SELinux and Host Firewalls
Temporarily disable SELinux for testing:
sudo setenforce 0

Step 10: Check Log Files
Important logs:
/var/log/messages
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/dmesg

Step 11: Review Network Configuration Files
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Step 12: DHCP and Routing Issues
Check DHCP server, lease pool, and lease time.

Review routing table:
ip route

Ensure interfaces are not administratively disabled:
ip link
ifconfig

Step 13: Reboot the Server (if needed)
sudo reboot

A simple reboot can sometimes resolve persistent networking issues.
